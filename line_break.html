    <p>
      Hypertext is text displayed on a computer display or other electronic
      devices with references (hyperlinks) to other text that the reader can
      immediately access.[1] Hypertext documents are interconnected by
      hyperlinks, which are typically activated by a mouse click, keypress set
      or by touching the screen. <br />
      from text, the term "hypertext" is also sometimes used to describe tables,
      images, and other presentational content formats with integrated
      hyperlinks.

      Hypertext is one of the key underlying concepts of the World Wide Web,[2]
      where Web pages are often written in the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).
      As implemented on the Web, hypertext enables the easy-to-use publication
      of information over the Internet.
